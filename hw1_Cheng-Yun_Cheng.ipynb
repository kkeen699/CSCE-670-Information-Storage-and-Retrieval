        "*Goals of this homework:* In this homework you will get first hand experience building a text-based mini search engine. In particular, there are three main learning objectives: (i) the basics of tokenization (e.g. stemming, case-folding, etc.) and its effect on information retrieval; (ii) basics of index building and Boolean retrieval; and (iii) basics of the Vector Space model and ranked retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Submission instructions (eCampus):* To submit your homework, rename this notebook as `UIN_hw1.ipynb`. For example, my homework submission would be something like `555001234_hw1.ipynb`. Submit this notebook via eCampus (look for the homework 1 assignment there). Your notebook should be completely self-contained, with the results visible in the notebook. We should not have to run any code from the command line, nor should we have to run your code within the notebook (though we reserve the right to do so). So please run all the cells for us, and then submit.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Late submission policy:* For this homework, you may use as many late days as you like (up to the 5 total allotted to you).\n",
        "\n",
        "*Collaboration policy:* You are expected to complete each homework independently. Your solution should be written by you without the direct aid or help of anyone else. However, we believe that collaboration and team work are important for facilitating learning, so we encourage you to discuss problems and general problem approaches (but not actual solutions) with your classmates. You may post on Piazza, search StackOverflow, etc. But if you do get help in this way, you must inform us by **filling out the Collaboration Declarations at the bottom of this notebook**. \n",

        "*Example: I found helpful code on stackoverflow at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11764539/writing-fizzbuzz that helped me solve Problem 2.*\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic rule is that no student should explicitly share a solution with another student (and thereby circumvent the basic learning process), but it is okay to share general approaches, directions, and so on. If you feel like you have an issue that needs clarification, feel free to contact either me or the TA."

However, it ignores the influence of the length of documents. Some documents get high TF-IDF scores only because they contain more words, not because they are more relevant to the query. For example, with the query \"time\", the song, Derek-minor-until-the-end-of-time-lyrics, whose score is the highest contains lots of words.\n",

The TF(D,phrase) is the number of times that the phrase occurs in document D, and the IDF(phrase) is changed to calculate the number of documents containing the phrase. On the other hand, if the other document dose not contain the phrase query, the origin BM25 would be used to rank it. Because the IDF value of a phrase is greater than the IDF value of a single word, the documents containing the phrase query would be at the top of the rank."
