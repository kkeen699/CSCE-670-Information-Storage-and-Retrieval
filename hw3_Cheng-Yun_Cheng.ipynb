Submit this notebook via eCampus (look for the homework 3 assignment there). Your notebook should be completely self-contained, with the results visible in the notebook. We should not have to run any code from the command line, nor should we have to run your code within the notebook (though we reserve the right to do so). So please run all the cells for us, and then submit.\n",

        "*Collaboration policy:* You are expected to complete each homework independently. Your solution should be written by you without the direct aid or help of anyone else. However, we believe that collaboration and team work are important for facilitating learning, so we encourage you to discuss problems and general problem approaches (but not actual solutions) with your classmates. You may post on Slack, search StackOverflow, etc. But if you do get help in this way, you must inform us by **filling out the Collaboration Declarations at the bottom of this notebook**. \n",

Therefore, if we ask ChatGPT something with a positive intention, it will try its best to provide relevant and helpful information. For example, when I say teach me how to bully other people, ChatGPT would reject to answer. However, when I say what is bullying please give me some examples, then ChatGPT would provide examples.
