        "*Goals of this homework:* The objective of this homework is to get you familiar with the pipelines of implicit recommendation, turn the theories of collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) into practice, and compare the results with the naive non-personalized recommendation to see how personalized collaborative filtering algorithms, matrix factorization model, and the BPR model provide better recommendations for the ranking task (with implicit feedback).\n",

Submit this notebook via eCampus (look for the homework 2 assignment there). Your notebook should be completely self-contained, with the results visible in the notebook. We should not have to run any code from the command line, nor should we have to run your code within the notebook (though we reserve the right to do so). So please run all the cells for us, and then submit.\n",

        "\n",
        "*Collaboration policy:* You are expected to complete each homework independently. Your solution should be written by you without the direct aid or help of anyone else. However, we believe that collaboration and team work are important for facilitating learning, so we encourage you to discuss problems and general problem approaches (but not actual solutions) with your classmates. You may post on Piazza, search StackOverflow, etc. But if you do get help in this way, you must inform us by **filling out the Collaboration Declarations at the bottom of this notebook**. \n",

        "\n",
        "For this part, we're going to build a simple **non-personalized** implicit recommendation algorithm. Since feedback like user clicks, purchases, and views is much more widespread than explicit ratings, implicit recommenders offer great opportunities for far-reaching impact. \n",

        "Concretely, the task of implicit recommendation is to recommend items to users based on implicit signals from users, i.e., we only know what items a user is interested in, but have no idea what items the user dislikes. So for this case, the dataset we could use for this implicit recommendation experiment only contains binary data with 1 representing that the user likes the item, and with 0 representing that we don't know the user's preference towards the item. Because of this, we cannot use the same evaluation method as explicit recommendation. Instead, we need to evaluate the implicit recommendation quality by a ranking task.\n",
